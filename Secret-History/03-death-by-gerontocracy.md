# Secret History #3: Death by Gerontocracy

## Introduction

Good afternoon, class. Today we examine what we call "death by gerontocracy" - rule by old people. In our previous session, we discussed the theories behind the decline of Western society and civilization. Today, we shift our focus to the reality on the ground: the actual trends and current examples of decline in the Western world.

## Case Study: The Southport Attack and Immigration Tensions

### The Incident

Our examination begins with Axel Ruda Kubana, a 17-year-old who, last year, took a knife and walked into a dance studio in Southport, Britain. He proceeded to stab young girls aged five, six, and seven, killing three of them. He was quickly arrested and, clearly displaying signs of mental illness, was sentenced to 52 years in prison - effectively a life sentence.

### The Aftermath: Riots and Misinformation

Following the attack, riots and protests erupted throughout Britain. Rumors spread online claiming the perpetrator was an asylum seeker and immigrant, fueling anti-immigrant sentiment. The protests were:
- Extremely heated and extremist in nature
- Anti-immigrant focused
- Led to violence between police and protesters
- Resulted in widespread civil unrest across Britain

The irony is that Kubana was not an immigrant - he was born in Wales to Rwandan parents, making him a British citizen. Despite this, the protesters felt virtuous and righteous, believing they were protecting their people against foreign threats.

## The Immigration Crisis Across the Western World

### Scale and Speed of Change

The current immigration crisis is characterized by unprecedented speed and scale:
- Post-COVID period saw massive spikes in immigration
- Most immigrants now come from Middle East, Africa, and East Asia rather than Europe
- Demographic changes are stark and visible

In Britain, dark brown areas on demographic maps show regions where immigrant populations have tripled in the past 5-10 years. In some areas, visitors report feeling as though they're in Morocco, Rwanda, or Egypt rather than Britain.

### Global Patterns

This phenomenon extends beyond Britain:

**Australia**: Massive post-COVID immigration spike, primarily from:
- India (largest source)
- China
- Philippines

**France**: Huge increases in immigration from African and Middle Eastern countries, leading to cultural dilution concerns

**Western Europe Overall**: UK, France, Italy, and Germany all experiencing unprecedented immigration and refugee influxes

## Economic Consequences

### Inflation and Cost of Living

The Consumer Price Index (CPI) shows dramatic spikes in basic goods prices including food and shelter. As immigrants arrive, quality of life deteriorates for existing residents who struggle to afford rent and food.

### Housing Crisis

The housing crisis is particularly acute in Canada:
- Massive immigration influx over five years
- Housing prices have skyrocketed beyond affordability
- Unlike the US (with stable housing prices), Canada shows disconnection between GDP growth and housing costs
- The "Canadian dream" of homeownership is effectively dead for young people

### The Housing Supply Paradox

A strange phenomenon emerges: despite increased immigration creating housing demand, housing supply remains relatively flat. This occurs because:
- Policy is controlled by vested interests who profit from the process
- Real estate developers benefit from artificial scarcity
- Existing property owners see their home values increase artificially
- Government serves these interests rather than national welfare

## Demographic Transformation

### Birth Rate Decline

Native populations show declining birth rates while immigration increases:
- In Canada, native birth rates steadily decline while immigration rises
- Immigrants now provide most new population growth
- 25% of Canadians are first-generation immigrants
- Current trends suggest very few white Canadians will remain in 40-50 years

### Political Goals

Despite housing unaffordability, inflation, and ethnic tensions, the Canadian government continues aggressive immigration policies:
- Canada's current population: 35-40 million
- Goal: 100 million people by 2100
- Majority will come from India and China
- No policy rollback or moratorium considered

### Political Power Shifts

Indians have become an extremely powerful political force in Canada:
- 22 Indian-descent MPs elected to parliament (out of 343 seats)
- Fewer than 10 Chinese-origin MPs despite longer presence and larger numbers
- Indians excel due to democratic experience and organizational skills
- Risk of eventual political takeover within 20-40 years

## Medical Assistance in Dying (MAID)

### Policy Introduction

Canada introduced MAID (euthanasia) approximately 10 years ago for people experiencing:
- Meaningless life feelings
- Depression
- Incurable diseases

The government distinguishes between suicide (bad) and government-assisted suicide (good), creating absurd rationalizations.

### Rapid Expansion

MAID statistics show alarming trends:
- 2016: ~1,000 deaths
- 2021: ~10,000 deaths
- Approval rates increased from 75% (2019) to 81%
- Canada leads globally in euthanasia rates
- Approval time reduced to as little as 10 days

### Demographics of Death

Primary reasons for MAID approval:
1. Loss of ability to engage in meaningful activities (unhappiness)
2. Loss of ability to perform daily living activities (minor disabilities)

Most deaths involve cancer patients - notably, cancer is expensive to treat and often non-terminal. The system effectively encourages poor people to die rather than burden the medical system.

## Financial System Distortions

### Stock Market Boom vs. Real Economy Decline

A paradox emerges:
- Stock markets booming worldwide
- 10% of population owns 90% of stocks in America
- Amazon stock: $7 (2008) to $300+ (current)
- Real economy productivity declining
- Fake financial economy rising while real productive economy falls

### Government Response: Gaslighting

Rather than acknowledge economic problems, governments engage in gaslighting:
- Deny recession exists
- Claim "state of transition" instead
- Tell citizens their perceptions are wrong
- Refuse to acknowledge problems

### Debt Crisis

**Government Debt**: 
- US debt: $37 trillion
- Until 1980, minimal debt for 200 years
- Current trajectory unsustainable

**Private Debt**: 
- Americans owe $17 trillion in credit cards and mortgages
- Middle class effectively finished
- Will never pay off accumulated debt

### Additional Decline Indicators

- Declining birth rates globally
- Canada selling resources to foreign investors
- Loss of national resource control

## Summary of Western Decline Signs

The evidence points to multiple simultaneous crises:

1. **Higher property prices** - Universal across Western nations
2. **Inflation and lower quality of life** - Basic necessities unaffordable
3. **Higher stock market valuations** - Increased inequality
4. **Less real economic growth** - Fewer productive jobs
5. **Euthanasia for the poor** - Systematic elimination of vulnerable populations
6. **Mass immigration** - Population replacement
7. **Lower birth rates** - Native population decline
8. **Greater public and private debt** - Unsustainable financial obligations
9. **Bureaucratic gaslighting** - Government denial of problems
10. **Privatization/asset stripping** - Loss of national resources

## Theories of Decline

Several theories attempt to explain these phenomena:

### Neoliberalism
The belief that economic growth solves all problems - if the economy runs fast enough, everyone benefits.

### Technofeudalism
Major corporations, particularly tech companies, seek world control by turning people into property-less slaves.

### World Government Theory
United Nations conspiracy to control the world and eliminate national sovereignty.

### Population Replacement Theory
Governments prefer Asian immigrants over white populations because Asians are perceived as more obedient and less democratic.

### Bureaucratic Incompetence
Simple government stupidity and incompetence.

## The Gerontocracy Analysis

### Who Benefits?

Rather than competing theories, we can analyze who benefits from current trends. The answer: **rich pensioners** benefit most from:

- **Higher property prices** - They own multiple houses
- **Higher stock market valuations** - They own most stocks  
- **Euthanasia for the poor** - Frees up healthcare resources
- **Mass immigration** - Provides cheap labor for services they need
- **Other trends** - Either benefit them or don't affect them

### Historical Context

Never before in human history have we had so many old, rich people. Demographics show explosive growth in 75+ and 60+ populations since 1900, creating unprecedented wealth concentration among the elderly.

**Important clarification**: Not all old people are rich, and not all rich people are old. However, there are more old people with money, and they exist in greater numbers than ever before.

### The Pension Crisis

Modern pension systems made two critical assumptions:
1. **People would die** - Canadian system expected death at 72 with retirement at 65
2. **Stock market returns** - Consistent growth assumptions

Both assumptions have failed:
- People live much longer than expected
- Pension funds (staffed by less capable financial professionals) consistently underperform
- Returns show dangerous volatility

### Demographic Reality

**2001 ratio**: 12.7 workers to 7.6 retirees
**Current trend**: More pensioners than workers
**Ideal ratio**: 3 workers per pensioner

This demographic inversion creates:
- Unsustainable pension systems
- Bankruptcy within 5-10 years
- Intergenerational wealth transfer crisis

### America's Aging Crisis

By 2040:
- 65 million Americans over 65
- 15 million Americans over 85
- The 85+ demographic controls most political power

This pattern repeats globally, particularly stark in Japan and Germany.

## Political Gerontocracy in Action

### Leadership Examples

**Joe Biden**: President in his 80s, physical mobility issues
**Mitch McConnell**: Senate leader experiencing public brain freeze episodes  
**Dianne Feinstein**: Died in office at 90, refused to retire

### Senate Demographics

The US Senate - America's most powerful political institution - is dominated by people above standard retirement age (66). Many senators work into their 90s, refusing retirement until death.

### Generational Characteristics

**Young People**: 
- Rebellious
- Creative  
- Open-minded
- Want systemic change

**Mature People**:
- Want slow progress
- Seek growth
- Desire consensus

**Elderly People**:
- Reactionary (oppose all change)
- Safety-focused
- Stubborn
- Want things their way

## Consequences of Gerontocracy

Living under elderly rule creates specific societal characteristics:

### Lockdown Mentality
When viruses appear, entire societies shut down to protect elderly populations, regardless of impact on younger generations.

### Police State Development
Not violent oppression, but total surveillance and control:
- **Example**: Canadian parents cannot discipline children but must call police for help
- Government interference in private family matters
- Comprehensive surveillance systems
- Online expression limitations (UK Online Safety Act 2022-23)

### Financial Control Systems
- **Digital currency** - Eliminates cash freedom, monitors all transactions
- **Transaction limitations** - Restricts purchases deemed "harmful"
- **Financial repression** - Complete monetary control

### Technological Control
- Facial recognition systems
- Future microchip implants  
- Comprehensive tracking and monitoring

### Mass Immigration
Elderly populations need:
- Nurses and caregivers
- Domestic workers
- Gardeners and laborers
- Cheap, obedient service providers

**Current example**: Trump announced plans for 600,000 Chinese students in the US - young, cheap, obedient, studious labor.

### Expanded Prison Systems
- Elderly fear of crime drives prison expansion
- Prisoners provide free labor
- Mass incarceration becomes economic policy

### Perpetual Warfare
Elderly populations readily send young people to die in wars for their perceived glory and interests.

## Student Questions and Responses

### Q: Can young people overthrow this system?

**A**: Nothing can be done. Young people are biologically programmed to respect elders - this exists throughout nature. People won't kill their grandparents, making resistance impossible. This biological programming allows elderly to send young people to war.

### Q: What happens when rich pensioners die?

**A**: Money flows from all other areas (education, healthcare, public services) into pension systems because:
- Elderly control policy
- They have time to organize politically  
- Society respects elderly needs
- No one wants to deny grandparents healthcare/pensions

### Q: Don't elderly eventually die?

**A**: Modern medicine allows wealthy elderly to live much longer than expected. A doctor confirmed that rich elderly people can remain alive as vegetables for 20+ years with proper medical care. Additionally, new generations age into elderly status, perpetuating the cycle - the green becomes the red.

The trend suggests elderly control will continue long-term because in wars and catastrophes, young people die while old people survive.

## Conclusion

We are witnessing an unprecedented historical phenomenon: the first time in human civilization that numerous old, wealthy people control society simultaneously. This "death by gerontocracy" creates systemic problems affecting housing, healthcare, immigration, financial systems, and basic freedoms.

The biological programming that makes humans respect elderly authority, combined with modern medicine extending life and wealth accumulation over time, creates an seemingly insurmountable system of elderly control that serves their interests while systematically disadvantaging younger generations.

This analysis will continue in our next session as we explore deeper implications of gerontocratic rule.# Death by Gerontocracy: Western Decline and the Rule of the Elderly

### The Aftermath: Riots and Misinformation

Following the attack, riots and protests erupted throughout Britain. Rumors spread online claiming the perpetrator was an asylum seeker and immigrant, fueling anti-immigrant sentiment. The protests were:

- Led to violence between police and protesters
- Resulted in widespread civil unrest across Britain

The irony is that Kubana was not an immigrant - he was born in Wales to Rwandan parents, making him a British citizen. Despite this, the protesters felt virtuous and righteous, believing they were protecting their people against foreign threats.
