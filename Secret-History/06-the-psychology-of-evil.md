# Secret History #6: The Psychology of Evil

## Historical Perspectives on Social Control Systems

### Introduction

This chapter explores theoretical frameworks for understanding how ancient civilizations developed systems of social control, with particular focus on the role of religious and psychological mechanisms in maintaining power structures. The content presented here is speculative and theoretical in nature, intended to encourage critical thinking about historical power dynamics.

### Review: Transformation of Religious Worldview

Before examining control mechanisms, we must understand how Western religious worldview transformed throughout history, fundamentally changing human perception in three key aspects:

#### The Three Fundamental Shifts

**1. From Mind-Led Reality to Brain-Created Mind**
- **Ancient Understanding**: Mind led to matter; the universe was conceived as one giant mind whose vibrations create atoms, leading to matter
- **Modern Scientific View**: The brain creates the mind (this conception presents certain philosophical challenges)

**2. From Metaphorical to Literal Understanding**
- **Ancient Approach**: The world was understood metaphorically, controlled by invisible forces (gods) that could be felt but not seen
- **Modern Scientific Approach**: "If you don't see it, it doesn't exist; if you cannot measure it, it does not exist"

**3. From Intuitive to Counterintuitive Learning**
- **Ancient Method**: Trusted heart and eyes; relied on intuition
- **Modern Educational Method**: Taught not to trust eyes; emphasis on data, tools, and theory over intuition

*Note: This shift explains why formal education can be challengingâ€”humans are natural learning machines, but modern education often contradicts intuitive understanding.*

### The Four Earliest Mass Civilizations

When examining social control mechanisms, we must first understand the earliest mass societies and their approaches to population management:

#### 1. China
- **Solution**: Bureaucracy
- **Mechanism**: Keju (civil service examination)
- **Result**: Population focused energy on children passing examinations to become officials
- **Modern Equivalent**: Gaokao system (identical principles)

#### 2. Indus Valley Civilization (Harappan)
- **Solution**: Religion
- **Characteristics**: Egalitarianism, equality, peacefulness
- **Legacy**: Became prototype for Buddhism
- **Result**: Long period of peaceful, prosperous society

#### 3. Mesopotamia
- **Solution**: Warfare
- **Geographic Factor**: No natural defenses (unlike China's mountains, deserts, seas)
- **Result**: Centuries of continuous warfare creating social cohesion through external threats

#### 4. Egypt
- **Solution**: Divine Kingship
- **Belief System**: Pharaoh as literal god
- **Challenge**: Pharaoh was human, creating vulnerability and risk

### Leadership Theory: The Three Essential Skills

Traditional educational approaches teach numerous leadership qualities (responsibility, wisdom, empathy, knowledge, etc.). However, historical analysis suggests successful leaders throughout history share three specific characteristics:

#### The Three Core Skills

**1. Unpredictability**
- People cannot predict leader's behavior
- Leader remains mysterious to followers
- Creates psychological advantage

**2. High Stress Tolerance**
- Ability to function despite intense pressure
- Emotional detachment from criticism
- Maintains performance under adversity

**3. Lack of Empathy**
- Self-focused decision-making
- Minimal concern for others' suffering
- Prioritizes personal/political goals over individual welfare

#### Psychological Framework: Dissociation

These three skills can be understood through the psychological concept of **dissociation**:

- **Definition**: Mental separation from body/experience
- **Effect**: Individual observes situations as if watching a movie of themselves
- **Alternative Term**: Multiple Personality Disorder
- **Historical Examples**: Leaders appear as "different people" in different circumstances

---

### Game Theory and Strategic Alliances

#### The Multi-Player Game

In large-scale political "games" involving millions of participants:

- **Winning Strategy**: Form secret alliances (cheating within the rules)
- **Advanced Strategy**: Participate in multiple powerful secret alliances simultaneously
- **Ultimate Position**: Become intersection point of various groups

#### The Loyalty Problem

Secret societies develop systems ensuring:
- Member loyalty
- Obedience to group directives  
- Prevention of betrayal

#### The Multiple Personality Solution

- **Strategy**: Create multiple personalities to prevent any single group from understanding true motivations
- **Application**: Different personality for different circumstances/alliances
- **Intelligence Usage**: Spies are specifically recruited for dissociative abilities
- **Selection Criteria**: Capacity for rapid dissociation and emotional detachment

---

### The Egyptian System: Programming the Pharaoh

#### The Challenge

- Pharaohs were born into position (not selected for psychological traits)
- Question: Can multiple personalities be artificially created?
- Answer: Yes, through systematic programming

#### Egyptian Mythology as Programming Script

Egyptian mythology differs fundamentally from other world mythologies (Greek, Chinese, Babylonian). Rather than stories to be believed, Egyptian myths function as scripts to be enacted.

##### The Three Primary Deities

**Ra (Sun God)**
- **Role**: Giver of life to universe
- **Identity**: Virtuous hero
- **Nightly Task**: Battles serpent Apep to ensure sunrise
- **Methods**: Various killing techniques (stabbing, lancing, burning, strangling)

**Osiris**
- **Role**: God of civilization, builder of Egypt
- **Identity**: Passive victim
- **Story**: Tricked by brother Set, killed, dismembered, scattered globally
- **Resurrection**: Wife Isis reassembles him, they conceive Horus

**Horus**
- **Role**: God of kingship and empire
- **Identity**: Vengeful child
- **Mission**: Reclaim throne through warfare with Set
- **Challenges**: Various trials including drowning contests and sexual domination

#### Programming Methodology

##### Theoretical Framework (Speculative)

Drawing from Kantian philosophy:
- **Noumena**: Things-in-themselves (unknowable true reality)
- **Phenomena**: Things we experience (controllable through experience manipulation)
- **Implication**: If experience can be controlled, memory can be programmed

##### The Ritual Process

**1. Identity Creation**
- Ra rituals: Pharaoh (under psychoactive substances) performs hero actions
- Osiris rituals: Pharaoh experiences victim scenarios (confinement, dismemberment simulation, sexual acts)
- Horus rituals: Pharaoh enacts revenge scenarios

**2. Trauma-Based Programming**
- Psychedelic enhancement of experiences
- Creation of dissociative states through trauma
- Multiple identity formation through repeated ritual participation

**3. Control Mechanisms**
- **Handler**: Priest wearing Isis mask provides support during traumatic experiences
- **Dependency**: Pharaoh develops reliance on "Isis" figure
- **Activation**: Scent-based triggers activate specific personalities
- **Implementation**: Different incenses/scents correspond to different identities

#### Near-Death Experience Component

##### Why Participants Consent

- Trauma and psychedelics create Near-Death Experiences (NDEs)
- Participants report spiritual transcendence
- Belief in divine contact justifies traumatic training
- Perceived access to spiritual wisdom

##### Priest Knowledge Acquisition

Priests experiment on themselves through:
- Self-induced drowning
- Self-inflicted wounds
- Starvation
- Various near-death experience techniques

### Modern Applications: Continuity of Ancient Techniques

#### 9/11 and Enhanced Interrogation

Following September 11, 2001, the United States implemented detention and interrogation programs that reveal striking parallels to ancient programming techniques.

##### Abu Ghraib Prison

- **Official Explanation**: Rogue soldiers acting without authorization
- **Reality**: Systematic program designed by psychologists
- **Funding**: CIA paid $80 million to develop enhanced interrogation techniques

##### The Psychologists

Two psychologists sued by victims revealed:
- Systematic design of interrogation program
- Government funding and approval
- Theoretical basis in "learned helplessness"

##### Learned Helplessness Theory

- **Developer**: Martin Seligman (also creator of "positive psychology")
- **Goal**: Transform "Ra" (virtuous hero) identity into "Osiris" (passive victim)
- **Application**: Psychological transformation through trauma

#### The ISIS Connection

##### Unexpected Outcome

Instead of creating compliant subjects, the program produced ISIS (Islamic State):
- **Name Significance**: ISIS = Egyptian goddess who saved Osiris
- **Recruitment Pattern**: Many ISIS fighters radicalized in US-controlled prisons
- **Academic Research**: Jeremy Suri and Andrew Thompson documented prison-to-extremism pipeline

##### Abu Zubaydah's Testimony

Saudi citizen Abu Zubaydah's account reveals interrogation techniques identical to Egyptian ritual script:
- Force-feeding and torture
- Strangulation
- Confinement in coffin-like structure
- Drowning simulation
- Power drill use (cutting/dismemberment simulation)
- Sexual humiliation

##### Theoretical Analysis

Rather than failed experiments, these programs may represent successful implementation of ancient programming techniques:
- **Goal**: Create controllable human weapons
- **Method**: Trauma-based programming using historical scripts
- **Result**: Programmable operatives for geopolitical purposes

### Social Control Systems: Ancient to Modern

#### Universal Principle

All societies prioritize social control as fundamental governance requirement.

#### Continuity Thesis

Human nature remains unchanged across millennia:
- Ancient Egyptian pharaoh control techniques
- Modern population management systems
- Identical underlying psychological principles

#### Contemporary Implementation

Modern social control operates through:
- **Mass Media**: Information and narrative control
- **Mass Education**: Standardized thought patterns  
- **Mass Psychology**: Behavioral modification at scale

---

### Critical Considerations and Questions

#### Infrastructure Control

**Question**: If social media serves social control purposes, why is it privately owned?

**Analysis**: 
- Internet infrastructure built by US military
- Global cable systems under military protection
- Private platforms operate on government-controlled foundation
- Public face vs. underlying control structure

#### Psychological Profession Paradox

**Observation**: Psychologists statistically show higher rates of mental illness than general population

**Questions**:
- Why do mental health professionals have more mental health issues?
- What explains limited measurable improvement in psychological treatment outcomes?
- How does this relate to psychological research applications?

### Conclusion and Disclaimers

#### Key Takeaways

1. **Historical Continuity**: Social control mechanisms show remarkable consistency across millennia
2. **Psychological Principles**: Human psychological vulnerabilities remain constant
3. **Technological Evolution**: Methods evolve while underlying principles persist
4. **Critical Analysis**: Question official narratives and examine historical patterns

#### Important Disclaimers

- **Speculative Nature**: Much content is theoretical speculation, not established fact
