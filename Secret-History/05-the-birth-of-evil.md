# Secret History #5: The Birth of Evil

## Introduction

This chapter explores the historical development and belief systems of secret societies in Western civilization. We examine their origins in ancient religious traditions, their philosophical foundations, and their esoteric interpretations of biblical texts. The analysis focuses on how these organizations emerged from suppressed religious practices and developed alternative theological frameworks that challenge orthodox Christianity.

## The Three Stages of Religious Development in the West

To understand secret societies, we must first examine the evolution of Western religious thought through three major phases:

### 1. The Mother Goddess Civilization

The earliest stage emerged with agricultural societies, centered around two fundamental concerns:
- Ensuring healthy crops and successful harvests
- Maximizing births to provide agricultural labor

**Core Beliefs:**
- **The Divine Womb**: Women's wombs were considered sacred portals between the spirit world and material reality
- **Interconnected Universe**: Everything existed in harmony - the womb, stars, and crops were all aligned
- **Astrological Guidance**: Star movements determined optimal times for planting and conception
- **Female Authority**: Women held high social status as representatives of the Mother Goddess

**Religious Symbols:**
- **The Bird**: Representing the Mother Goddess's dominion over the sky
- **The Bull**: Symbolizing virility and male energy necessary for creation

**Social Structure:**
- No private property - communal ownership
- No social hierarchy - egalitarian society
- Fertility cults involving communal sexual rituals
- Multiple partners to ensure the best genetic outcomes

### 2. Polytheism (Many Gods)

The transition occurred due to warfare and resource competition as populations grew.

**Key Changes:**
- **Property Rights**: Men received women as war rewards, establishing ownership
- **Hierarchical Gods**: War outcomes determined divine rankings
- **The Pantheon System**: Defeated gods became subordinate to victorious deities (e.g., Greek pantheon with Zeus supreme)
- **Male Dominance**: Men's roles increased while women's status decreased

**Cosmological Framework:**
- Humans as playthings of gods
- Gods resembling immortal mortals with similar desires and behaviors
- Higher forces (Fortune, Fate) controlling even the gods
- Universal laws (like Justice) providing cosmic structure
- Luck and divine favor determining success, not moral goodness

### 3. Monotheism (One God)

Emerged with empire-building, particularly the Roman Empire and Christianity.

**Revolutionary Concepts:**
- **One True God**: Replaced diverse, complex spiritual understanding
- **Universal Truth**: Single correct understanding of reality
- **Concept of Evil**: Opposition to divine truth became morally wrong
- **Individual Faith**: Personal relationship with God superseded community bonds

**Counter-intuitive Nature:**
Unlike previous intuitive religious systems, monotheism required active suppression of polytheistic traditions, driving them underground.

## The Underground Response: Mystery Schools and Secret Societies

### From Mystery Schools to Secret Societies

When monotheism suppressed polytheistic traditions, the ancient knowledge survived in hidden forms:

**Mystery Schools (Pre-Christian Era):**
- Maintained Mother Goddess traditions
- Preserved the belief that "mind leads to matter"
- Conducted secret sexual rituals for cosmic communion
- Required death oaths to protect their secrets
- Attracted elite participation

**Evolution into Secret Societies:**
With Christianity's rise, mystery schools became perceived threats to imperial power, forcing them deeper underground. Known historical examples include:
- Knights Templars
- Rosicrucians
- Illuminati
- Freemasons

### Core Secret: Mind Creates Matter

**Fundamental Principle:**
Secret societies preserve the ancient belief that consciousness precedes and creates physical reality, opposing the modern scientific view that matter creates mind.

**Supporting Arguments:**
- The human brain's limited capacity seems inadequate for consciousness's complexity
- Mainstream neuroscience avoids addressing the "hard problem" of consciousness
- Ancient civilizations accomplished feats beyond modern understanding (e.g., Egyptian pyramids)

## Esoteric Biblical Interpretation

Secret societies maintain alternative readings of Christian scripture that challenge orthodox theology.

### Orthodox Christian Narrative (Canonical Version)

**The Six Covenants:**
1. **Adam and Eve**: Paradise lost through disobedience
2. **Noah**: Divine promise never to destroy the world again
3. **Abraham**: Chosen people and promised land
4. **Moses**: Divine law (Ten Commandments)
5. **David**: Eternal dynasty promised
6. **Jesus**: Universal salvation through sacrifice

**Problems with Orthodox Interpretation:**
- Why such severe punishment for eating fruit?
- Why destroy the world if humans remained wicked afterward?
- Why did God need to sacrifice his son?

### The Esoteric Alternative

**Sources:** Book of Enoch and Gospel of Thomas (non-canonical texts)

#### The Nephilim Explanation

**Genesis Reinterpreted:**
- Angels descended and mated with human women
- Their offspring (Nephilim) enslaved humanity
- God destroyed the world to eliminate Nephilim
- Nephilim spirits survived as demons
- Modern secret societies believe Nephilim descendants still control world wealth and power

#### The Gnostic Cosmology

**The True Divine Hierarchy:**

1. **The Monad**: The true, original God - pure consciousness that creates through vibration
2. **The Diets**: Divine pairs emanating from the Monad, capable of creating universes
3. **Sophia's Error**: The diet Sophia attempted solo creation, producing a flawed being
4. **The Demiurge**: Sophia's monstrous creation, believing itself the supreme god
5. **The False Reality**: Earth and humanity created by the Demiurge as a prison

**Jesus as Liberator:**
- Sent by the Monad to reveal the truth
- Taught that divine spark exists within humans
- Executed by powers protecting the false reality
- Message: reject materialism, embrace spiritual knowledge

**The Divine Spark:**
- Humans contain fragments of the true God (Monad)
- Spiritual practices can awaken this inner divinity
- Death allows return to the true divine realm
- Material world is illusory prison

## Literary Evidence: Paradise Lost Analysis

John Milton's "Paradise Lost" serves as a foundational text for many secret societies, encoding esoteric knowledge within epic poetry.

### Milton's Background
- Member of secret societies
- Advocate for free speech and rebellion against authority
- Composed the epic while blind, suggesting prophetic inspiration
- The work functions as Britain's national epic

### Satan's Heroic Speeches

#### Speech 1: The Heroic Leader
Satan volunteers for the dangerous mission to corrupt humanity, demonstrating:
- Noble self-sacrifice for his followers
- Heroic leadership willing to face unknown dangers
- Symbolic representation of the soul's journey to enlightenment

**Esoteric Interpretations:**
- Satan's journey parallels the soul's ascent from material to spiritual realms
- The description mirrors birth imagery - escape from the womb-prison
- Secret societies use this speech in initiation ceremonies

#### Speech 2: The Serpent's Logic
Satan (as serpent) convinces Eve to eat the forbidden fruit through logical argument:

**Key Arguments:**
- God's prohibition makes no logical sense for a benevolent deity
- True gods would reward knowledge-seeking, not punish it
- Understanding good and evil is necessary for moral development
- God may be testing humanity's courage to transcend limitations

### Biblical Verification

**Textual Evidence Supporting Satan's Claims:**
When examining Genesis directly:
- The serpent accurately predicts the consequences of eating the fruit
- Adam and Eve do not die as God warned
- Their "eyes are opened" and they gain knowledge
- God admits they have "become like one of us, knowing good and evil"
- Banishment occurs not as punishment for disobedience, but to prevent access to the Tree of Life

**The Two Trees:**
- Tree of Knowledge: Grants divine understanding
- Tree of Life: Provides immortality
- Combined, they would make humans fully divine
- This reveals God's fear of human potential, not protective love

### Eve's Divine Intuition

Eve's willingness to risk death suggests inner knowledge of truth - the divine spark recognizing authentic wisdom despite authoritative deception.

## The Nephilim Legacy

### Biblical Foundation
Scripture describes the Nephilim as offspring of "sons of God" and human women, identified as "heroes of old, warriors of renown."

**Mythological Connection:**
- These heroes include figures like Hercules, Achilles, and Theseus
- Their divine parents correspond to gods like Zeus, Ares, and Apollo
- Monotheism reframes polytheistic deities as rebellious angels

### Modern Implications
Secret societies maintain that:
- Nephilim bloodlines survive in contemporary elite families
- Their supernatural longevity enables accumulation of vast wealth and power
- They continue to manipulate human civilization from behind the scenes

## Theological Framework of Secret Societies

### Core Spiritual Principles

1. **Inner Divinity**: The true God exists within human consciousness
2. **False External God**: Prayer to external deities serves the Demiurge
3. **Self-Reliance**: Truth comes through inner exploration, not submission to authority
4. **Redemptive Transgression**: Growth requires making mistakes and learning from them
5. **Necessary Opposition**: Good and evil must coexist for spiritual development

### The Path to Enlightenment

**Requirements for Spiritual Awakening:**
- Rejection of materialism and competition
- Embrace of love and community
- Pursuit of knowledge over comfort
- Willingness to challenge authority
- Trust in inner divine guidance

**The Testing Process:**
Secret societies believe most people cannot handle these truths and will either:
- Reject them as insanity
- Report truth-tellers to authorities
- Remain trapped in material illusions

Therefore, they wait for individuals to "wake up" naturally and approach them, then conduct careful testing before revealing deeper knowledge.

## Conclusion: The Noble Mission

Secret societies originated from a desire to preserve ancient wisdom about:
- The primacy of consciousness over matter
- The divine nature of human beings
- The illusory character of material reality
- The path to spiritual liberation

While maintaining this knowledge required secrecy and has sometimes led to corruption over time, the foundational mission represents humanity's oldest spiritual traditions - the belief that we are divine beings temporarily imprisoned in a false reality, capable of returning to our true cosmic nature through knowledge, love, and inner awakening.

The tension between orthodox religious authority and esoteric spiritual knowledge continues to shape Western civilization, with secret societies serving as guardians of alternative cosmologies that challenge dominant theological and scientific paradigms.
