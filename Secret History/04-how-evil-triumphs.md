# Secret History #4: How Evil Triumphs

## Introduction: The Nature of Evil in the World

This chapter explores controversial theories about power structures and the mechanisms through which groups maintain control. The discussion involves speculation and theorizing, presenting analytical tools rather than absolute truths for understanding world events.

## Contemporary Case Study: Gaza as Ritual Sacrifice

### The Current Situation

The ongoing conflict in Gaza serves as a starting point for examining patterns of power and control. With 47% of Gaza's population under 18 years old, the demographic impact of the conflict is particularly significant.

### The Visibility Paradox

The visibility of the Gaza conflict raises questions about intentionality. If the goal were purely strategic elimination, more covert methods exist - poison, biological agents, or other technologies that could achieve objectives without global attention. The public nature of the actions suggests a different purpose.

### Religious Eschatology and Strategic Purpose

According to this theory, extremist interpretations of Jewish eschatology anticipate a final conflict where Israel faces the entire world, with divine intervention ensuring Israel's ultimate triumph. The deliberate creation of global opposition serves this eschatological framework.

## Historical Patterns of Ritual Sacrifice

### Ancient Civilizations

- **Aztecs**: Archaeological evidence reveals temples containing thousands of human skulls, indicating mass sacrifice before warfare
- **Phoenicians**: Particularly the Carthaginians, practiced child sacrifice according to Roman historical accounts
- **Romans**: Conducted ritualized executions of enemy leaders after military victories, strangling captives at the Temple of Jupiter following triumphal parades

### The Strategic River: Unity Through Isolation

Drawing from Chinese military strategy, the concept involves positioning forces with no retreat option - fighting with a river at one's back. In the modern context, transgression serves as this metaphorical river, creating a point of no return that unifies the group.

## The Thought Experiment: Monkey Island

### Initial Conditions

Imagine 100 men from diverse backgrounds - different languages, ethnicities, education levels, ages 15-65 - mysteriously transported to an island with:
- Flesh-eating monkeys throughout the territory
- One safe central hill
- Resources located in dangerous monkey-inhabited areas
- No escape possible

### Group Formation Process

1. **Language Development**: Despite linguistic diversity, a common communication system emerges rapidly
2. **Mythological Framework**: Shared stories create a founding mythology and sense of divine purpose
3. **Leadership Selection**: The leader emerges not through wisdom or experience, but through demonstration of ultimate sacrifice and commitment
4. **Ritual Development**: Strange practices evolve to maintain group unity, including funeral rites and other bonding ceremonies

### The Development of Synchronicity

The extreme circumstances foster what's termed "synchronicity" - a hive-mind state where group members:
- Act in perfect coordination
- Develop telepathic-like awareness of each other's conditions
- Sacrifice individual survival for group welfare without hesitation
- Experience instantaneous decision-making for collective benefit

### Return to Reality

Upon returning to the normal world, this group would:
- Maintain their bonds and shared experience
- Transmit their culture to descendants
- Gradually assume positions of hidden control
- Operate as a secret elite behind apparent leaders

## Historical Analogies: Military Societies

### Sparta

**Educational System:**
- Boys removed from homes at ages 5-6
- Subjected to hazing by older boys (ages 10-11)
- Developed bonds through shared suffering
- Mentorship relationships with adult soldiers during puberty
- Graduation ritual involving the killing of helots (slaves) found violating curfew

**Results:** Sparta became the dominant military power in Greece, feared and hated by other city-states but internally unified.

### Thebes: The Sacred Band

- Adapted Spartan methods but made participation voluntary
- 300 elite soldiers operating as pairs of lovers
- Historical context: same-sex relationships were culturally acceptable and strategic
- Became the premier military force after Sparta

### Macedonia

- Philip II studied and refined Theban methods
- Created the army that Alexander the Great used to conquer Persia
- At the Battle of Chaeronea (338 BCE), defeated the combined forces of Thebes and Athens
- The Sacred Band fought to the death to allow allies to escape

## Game Theory and Secret Coordination

### The Million-Player Game

In a competitive environment with one million participants where only one can win:
- **Cheating** becomes necessary for victory
- **Coordination** provides advantage over individual players
- **Secret coordination** avoids triggering defensive responses from others

### Methods of Coordination

Traditional coordination methods include:
- Family bonds
- Religious affiliation
- Shared ethnicity/language
- Common leadership

**Problem:** These methods are visible and prompt counter-coordination from competitors.

### Transgression as Secret Coordination

**The Theory:** Breaking taboos creates a unique coordination mechanism because:
1. **Secrecy requirement**: Participants must maintain silence or face punishment
2. **Escalating commitment**: Breaking greater taboos requires greater trust
3. **Psychological empowerment**: Transgression creates feelings of liberation and divine access
4. **Group exclusivity**: Only those who participate can be trusted

### The Addiction Mechanism

Transgression follows an escalating pattern:
1. **Minor pranks** (toilet papering, small theft)
2. **Progressive rule-breaking** with increasing severity
3. **Ultimate taboos** that create unbreakable bonds
4. **Ritualization** of transgressive acts

## Philosophical Framework: Understanding Reality

### Kant's Model

**The Problem of Perception:**
- **Phenomena**: The world we experience through our mental filters
- **Noumena**: Objective reality we can never directly know
- Our minds actively construct reality by adding space and time

**Three Resulting Questions:**
1. What is the noumena?
2. Who gave us our mental filters?
3. How do our individual perceptions align?

### Hegel's Solution: The Geist

**Definition of Geist:** A combination of three concepts:
- **Ghost**: Parallel spiritual reality
- **Geyser**: Expanding, explosive force
- **Gist**: Essential truth or core

**Hegel's Answers:**
1. The noumena is the spiritual world (Geist)
2. The Geist provides our mental filters
3. Shared Geist explains aligned perceptions

### Platonic and Gnostic Cosmology

**The Creation Process:**
- **The One/Monad**: Supreme divine source
- **Divine breathing**: Creates vibrations generating new beings
- **Dyads**: Pairs of forces creating multiple realities
- **Earth**: The outermost shell of this multi-dimensional system

### Return to the Source

**Plato's Path:** Pursuit of knowledge, particularly sacred geometry, enables return to the Monad

**Dante's Path:** Universal love provides access to the divine spark within everyone

## The Problem of Evil

### Plato's Response

The material world is illusory and unimportant. Those who control earthly power are welcome to it - focus should remain on knowledge and spiritual development.

### Dante's Response

**Free Will Theory:**
- The Monad grants free will as the greatest gift
- Evil results from misuse of free will
- Divine intervention would negate free will
- Occasional messengers (Plato, Dante, Jesus) provide guidance
- Choice to believe remains with individuals

### The Material World's Defenders

Those in earthly power have incentive to:
- Deny the spiritual framework
- Emphasize material reality as the only truth
- Promote scientific materialism that rejects unseen forces
- Maintain systems that prevent spiritual development

## Transgression and Spiritual Access

### The Alignment Theory

Transgressive acts allegedly allow access to specific frequencies or websites within the multi-dimensional spiritual system. By committing identical transgressive acts, groups lock onto the same spiritual "frequency," enabling synchronicity.

### Evil Forces in the Model

The spiritual dimension contains both beneficial and harmful entities. Transgressive groups may be aligning with lower, destructive spiritual forces rather than approaching the divine Monad.

## Social Control and Love

### Anti-Love Society

Modern social structures allegedly prevent natural loving relationships:
- **Educational systems** prioritize grades over happiness
- **Economic pressures** force parents to deny children's free will
- **Social expectations** prevent authentic human connections

### The Maintenance of Power

Existing power structures require:
- Denial of spiritual reality
- Emphasis on material success
- Prevention of deep human bonding
- Rationalization of control systems

## Questions and Clarifications

### The Nature of the Monad

The Monad represents ultimate reality - infinite, eternal, and unchanging. Different traditions and thinkers propose various methods of approach (knowledge vs. love) but acknowledge the same fundamental source.

### Evil as Distance from Truth

In this framework, evil is defined as movement away from the Monad toward pure materialism. The denial of spiritual reality and the embrace of purely physical existence constitutes the fundamental error.

### Universal Religious Patterns

The similarity between Buddhist, Hindu, Platonic, and other spiritual traditions suggests common access to the Geist - the universal spiritual dimension that provides inspiration and insight across cultures and time periods.

## Conclusion: Theoretical Framework

This speculative model proposes that:
- Secret coordination through transgression enables group control
- Historical military societies demonstrate these patterns
- Philosophical traditions point toward spiritual reality beyond material existence
- Current power structures maintain themselves by denying spiritual truth
- Understanding these patterns provides analytical tools for examining world events
