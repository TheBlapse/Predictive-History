# Secret History #7: Death by Meritocracy

## Introduction

The meritocracy is the idea that people should succeed based on their talent, ability, and hard work. In theory, this sounds like a noble concept, and indeed, the educational system is built around this premise: good students attend the best universities and subsequently secure the best jobs. However, this chapter examines the significant problems with meritocracy and argues that this system is actually damaging American society and spreading its negative effects worldwide.

## The Evolution of America's Complex Admissions System

### Historical Context: From Religious Colony to Elite Institutions

#### The Puritan Foundation (1600s)
- **Religious Conflict in England**: Major tension between Protestants (Puritans/Dissenters) and the Anglican Church (headed by the king)
- **Protestant Beliefs**: Individual relationship with God through Bible reading, making education and literacy a divine imperative
- **Migration to America**: The king encouraged Dissenters to establish colonies in America, leading to the founding of a religious theocracy

#### Establishment of Elite Universities
- **Harvard's Origins**: Founded to train ministers and study the Bible, representing the "New Jerusalem" ideal
- **The Ivy League Formation**: Harvard inspired the creation of Yale and Princeton, collectively forming what became known as the Ivy League
- **Evolution from Religious to Social**: As America became wealthier and less religious, these institutions transformed into exclusive social clubs for the wealthy

### The Three-Tiered System (circa 1900)

By 1900, American higher education had developed into three distinct categories:

1. **State Schools (A&M Universities)**: 
   - Designed for the majority of students
   - Focused on practical trades: agriculture, mechanics, engineering
   - Provided pathways for poor students to learn trades and achieve economic mobility

2. **Research Universities**: 
   - Modeled after German institutions (the global leaders in science and technology)
   - Examples: University of Chicago, Johns Hopkins
   - Focused on scientific research and academic excellence

3. **Ivy League Social Clubs**: 
   - Exclusively for wealthy students
   - Emphasized social bonding through activities like drinking, parties, and sports
   - Created networks among America's future leaders

### The Transformation: Harvard's Strategic Response

#### The Scholarship Program and SAT Creation
- **The Problem**: Harvard recognized that the brightest students were attending research universities, potentially making the Ivy League less relevant
- **The Solution**: James B. Conant (Harvard President) instituted scholarship programs and created the SAT to identify and recruit the most talented students nationwide
- **The Result**: Harvard began attracting top academic talent while maintaining its social prestige

#### The Holistic Admissions System
When wealthy alumni complained that their children faced increased competition, Harvard developed a new approach:

- **Beyond Test Scores**: Introduced "holistic" evaluation considering character, extracurriculars, essays, and recommendations
- **The Real Purpose**: This system was designed to limit Jewish enrollment (later extended to Asian students) while maintaining plausible deniability
- **Key Principles**:
  - **Secrecy**: No obligation to explain admission decisions
  - **Discretion**: Complete freedom to accept or reject any candidate

## Harvard as a Venture Capital Firm

### The Investment Mentality

Harvard functions essentially as an investment firm, seeking students with the highest potential for extraordinary success rather than merely academic excellence.

#### The Admissions Thought Experiment
Consider four hypothetical applicants:
1. Best math genius from China
2. Best basketball player in America  
3. Best student academically
4. Third-generation Harvard legacy

**Harvard's Choice**: The legacy student, because family connections virtually guarantee success in American society.

**Second Choice**: The athlete, who has demonstrated exceptional drive and competitive spirit.

**Least Likely**: The math genius, who will likely become "just" a professor.

### The High-Risk, High-Reward Strategy

Harvard prefers to admit students who might:
- Become presidents, CEOs, or cultural icons
- Generate significant media attention and brand recognition
- Fail spectacularly (acceptable collateral damage)

Rather than students who will:
- Achieve steady, predictable success
- Become professors, doctors, or other professionals
- Lead stable, fulfilled lives without extraordinary achievement

## Personal Case Study: A Yale Admission

### Application Profile
- **Academic Record**: Top 10 of 200 students (not #1 or #2)
- **Test Scores**: 1400/1600 SAT (good but not exceptional)
- **Activities**: Soccer (not athletic), school newspaper editor, quiz team captain
- **Essay**: Generic piece about physicist Richard Feynman
- **Recommendations**: Teachers found the applicant "ambitious" (a negative trait in Canadian culture)

### The Hidden Factors Yale Saw
Despite the mediocre application, Yale identified key indicators:

#### Socioeconomic Background
- **Poverty**: Required application fee waiver
- **Immigration**: Born in China, immigrated at age 6
- **Social Mobility**: Transferred from poor to wealthy high school despite institutional resistance

#### Psychological Profile: Dissociative Personality Disorder Traits
1. **Desperation**: College admission felt like life-or-death
2. **Insecurity**: Deep-seated need to prove worth through achievement
3. **Transgressive Behavior**: Willing to break social rules to advance

Yale recognized these traits as indicators of someone who might achieve extraordinary success or spectacular failureâ€”exactly the type of high-risk investment they sought.

## The Traumatic Nature of Elite Education

### The Hunger Games Environment

#### At Yale/Harvard
- **Relentless Competition**: Students compete against the world's most competitive peers
- **Multiple Battlefields**: Classroom discussions, club admissions, graduate school applications, scholarships
- **Psychological Impact**: Creates deep insecurity and need for constant achievement
- **Social Isolation**: Everyone becomes a potential threat in zero-sum competitions

#### High School Preparation
- **Competitive Environment**: High schools must prepare students for elite college competition
- **Achievement Pressure**: Focus shifts from learning to grade accumulation
- **Extracurricular Arms Race**: Students must demonstrate exceptional achievement in multiple areas

#### Parenting Systems
Two contrasting approaches:

**Healthy Parenting**: "I love you unconditionally. No matter what you do, I will support you."
- **Result**: Happy, secure, fulfilled children
- **Career Outcome**: Often become teachers or other helping professionals

**Meritocratic Parenting**: "I don't have time for you, but if you win competitions or get perfect grades, I'll reward you."
- **Result**: Trauma-driven achievement orientation
- **Career Outcome**: May reach elite positions but often at great personal cost

## The Global Spread and Consequences

### Statistical Evidence of Meritocracy's Impact

#### Rising Inequality Despite Educational Expansion
- **College Attendance**: Increased from 5% (1940) to 35% today
- **Income Inequality**: Gini coefficient has risen dramatically
- **Social Mobility**: Fewer people now earn more than their parents compared to 1940
- **Wealth Concentration**: Top 1% controls majority of American wealth

#### Educational Costs and Debt
- **Tuition Growth**: Far outpaced wage growth
- **Student Debt**: Only form of debt that cannot be discharged in bankruptcy
- **Intergenerational Impact**: Debt can pass to children upon parent's death

#### Mental Health Crisis
- **Rising Depression**: Particularly among middle-class and wealthy teenagers
- **Achievement Pressure**: Students focused on grades rather than learning
- **Failure Phobia**: System punishes failure, eliminating opportunities for growth

### The Harvard Success Story

#### Institutional Metrics
- **Acceptance Rate**: Declined from 90% (1940) to 5% today
- **Endowment**: Approximately $40 billion (more than most countries)
- **Alumni Wealth**: More billionaires than any other institution (127 in 2024)

#### Elite Dominance
Harvard and Ivy League graduates dominate American leadership:
- **Billionaires**: 7% of Americans worth over $100 million are Harvard graduates
- **Political Power**: Overrepresented in federal judges, senators, Fortune 500 CEOs
- **Cultural Influence**: Dominate among Pulitzer Prize winners, bestselling authors
- **Military Leadership**: Even present among generals and admirals

### The Self-Perpetuating System

#### Secret Societies and Elite Networks
- **Harvard**: Porcellian Club
- **Princeton**: Ivy Club  
- **Yale**: Skull and Bones

These organizations create lifelong networks that maintain elite dominance across generations.

#### Political Case Study: 2004 Election
Both major party nominees (George W. Bush and John Kerry) were Yale Skull and Bones members, illustrating the closed nature of American political leadership.

## Case Studies in Elite Formation

### Barack Obama: The Promise and Reality of Change

#### The 2008 Campaign
- **Promise**: Hope and change for a rigged system
- **Credential**: Columbia undergraduate, Harvard Law School
- **Appeal**: Positioned as outsider despite elite education

#### The Economic Crisis Response
When the 2008 financial crisis struck:
- **The Problem**: Wall Street corruption led by Ivy League graduates destroyed the economy
- **Obama's Solution**: Appointed more Ivy League graduates (Larry Summers from Harvard, Tim Geithner from Dartmouth)
- **The Contradiction**: Used "moral hazard" arguments to help banks while denying aid to ordinary homeowners
- **The Result**: Banks were saved, people were abandoned, leading to political backlash

### JD Vance: The Adaptable Elite
- **Background**: Author of "Hillbilly Elegy"
- **Political Evolution**: Initially opposed Trump, then became his strongest supporter
- **Characteristic**: Complete adaptability based on political advantage
- **Pattern**: Like Obama, represents elite flexibility rather than principled leadership

### Johnny Kim: The Perfect Meritocratic Product
- **Achievements**: Navy SEAL, Harvard Medical School graduate, NASA astronaut
- **Trauma Background**: Witnessed police kill his abusive father in 2002
- **Psychological Profile**: Channeled trauma into extraordinary achievement
- **The Problem**: No original ideas or vision beyond personal success

## The Destruction of American Society

### Educational System Collapse
- **Grade Obsession**: Students and parents focus solely on grades rather than learning
- **Teacher Intimidation**: Educators afraid to challenge students due to complaint culture
- **Learning Deficit**: System produces credential-holders rather than educated citizens

### Social and Political Consequences
- **Political Polarization**: Elite dominance creates resentment and division
- **Corruption**: Interconnected elite networks enable systemic abuse
- **Economic Mismanagement**: $37 trillion national debt, repeated financial crises
- **Cultural Decay**: Loss of American identity and social cohesion

### Elite Characteristics
The current American elite is characterized by:
- **Soullessness**: No genuine convictions or principles
- **Mediocrity**: Success based on networking rather than competence
- **Lack of Imagination**: Inability to envision alternatives to current system

## Solutions and Alternatives

### Systemic Solutions
**Primary Recommendation**: Make elite universities public institutions
- **Rationale**: Government control would reduce secretive, self-serving behavior
- **Reality**: Unlikely due to entrenched elite power

### Individual Strategies

#### Reject False Meritocratic Values
**Traditional Success Model** (Pre-Meritocracy):
1. **Open-mindedness**: Recognize you have much to learn
2. **Embrace Failure**: View mistakes as learning opportunities
3. **Reflection**: Take time to process experiences
4. **Resilience**: Develop ability to recover from setbacks
5. **Genuine Learning**: Focus on understanding rather than achievement

**Meritocratic Model** (Current System):
1. **Grade Focus**: Prioritize GPA over learning
2. **Failure Avoidance**: Any failure threatens college admission
3. **Over-scheduling**: No time for reflection or self-discovery
4. **Surface Learning**: Memorize for tests, forget immediately

#### The Psychological Problem: Competing Mindsets

**Altruistic Mode**:
- **Focus**: Helping others, building relationships
- **Outcome**: Creativity, passion, genuine connection
- **Environment**: Collaborative, supportive

**Utilitarian Mode**:
- **Focus**: Personal advancement, competition
- **Outcome**: Achievement, success, but often emptiness
- **Environment**: Competitive, zero-sum

**The Harvard Contradiction**: The system demands students pretend to be altruistic while actually being utilitarian, creating internal conflict and requiring people to become skilled actors rather than authentic individuals.

### Personal Recommendations

#### For Wealthy Students
Elite universities may be beneficial because they provide networks and maintain existing advantages.

#### For Poor Students
Elite universities may be harmful because they:
- **Create Arrogance**: False sense of superiority
- **Promote Utilitarianism**: Destroy genuine learning interest  
- **Narrow Focus**: Eliminate creativity and exploration
- **Remove Resilience**: Create inability to handle failure

#### The Alternative Path
1. **Value Real Learning**: Focus on developing skills and understanding
2. **Accept Failure**: Use setbacks as growth opportunities
3. **Maintain Open-mindedness**: Continue asking questions throughout life
4. **Develop Resilience**: Build ability to recover from disappointments
5. **Pursue Authentic Interests**: Follow genuine passions rather than status

## Conclusion

The meritocratic system, while appearing fair and rational on the surface, has created a destructive cycle that:
- Concentrates power among a narrow elite
- Traumatizes students and families
- Destroys genuine education
- Perpetuates inequality
- Corrupts political and economic systems
- Spreads these problems globally

True success comes not from elite credentials but from developing authentic capabilities, maintaining ethical principles, and contributing meaningfully to society. The challenge is recognizing these truths and choosing a different path in a world that rewards conformity to meritocratic ideals.
