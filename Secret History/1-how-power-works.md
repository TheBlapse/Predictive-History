# Secret History #1: How Power Works

## Introduction: A Class of Ideas

Welcome to a semester-long exploration of how the world truly works. This is not a class about what to think, but rather **how to think**. Our goal is to train and augment your imagination so that you can see the world much more clearly.

### The Kantian Foundation

We begin with Emmanuel Kant, arguably the greatest philosopher in Western history, who taught us a fundamental truth about reality:

- **The Noumena**: The objective reality - things as they exist in themselves
- **The Phenomena**: The world as it appears to us through our senses

Kant revealed that **we can never know objective reality**. We perceive the world through our senses, which warp and change reality into a structure we can process. Time and space, for example, do not exist outside of us - we add them to understand reality.

> **Key Insight**: Reality is what we imagine it to be. There is no objective reality accessible to us. Life is a constant process of imagination.

## Course Structure: Past, Present, and Future

### Present: Geopolitics
- Study current conflicts (Ukraine, Middle East)
- Develop analytical models to understand why events occur
- Test our understanding against reality

### Future: Predictions
- Use our analytical models to make predictions
- Validate the accuracy of our models (similar to testing AI systems)

### Past: Secret History
- Apply validated models to uncover the true history of humanity
- Reveal how the history taught in schools is often false - a system implanted by powerful people

### The Central Question: How Does Power Work?

Understanding power leads to liberation and freedom. Once you understand how you're being manipulated, you can live authentically and see the world as it truly is.

## Three Pillars of Modern Power

### 1. Money: The Great Illusion

#### The Banking Thought Experiment

Imagine I open a bank:
- You deposit $5 million
- I promise 1% interest
- I lend $4.5 million to a restaurant owner at 10% interest
- **Question**: How much money is actually in the bank?

**Traditional Answer**: $500,000 (the required reserve)
**Reality**: $9.5 million in the system

#### Historical Origins of Banking

The system evolved from medieval merchant practices:

1. **Gold Storage**: Merchants stored gold with banks for safekeeping
2. **Receipts**: Banks issued contracts (receipts) as proof of deposits
3. **Trade Facilitation**: Receipts became easier to transport than gold
4. **Money Creation**: Banks began lending receipts while keeping the gold, effectively doubling the money supply

#### The Problem with Scarcity

**The Paradox**: If banks can create infinite money, why do we have poverty?

**Common (Wrong) Answer**: Scarcity of resources
**True Answer**: Artificial scarcity is maintained to create the illusion that money is valuable

> **Critical Insight**: Poverty exists not because of scarcity, but because powerful people need to maintain the illusion that money is scarce. Otherwise, no one would work.

#### The Function of Economic Crises

- **Purpose**: Destroy excess money in the system
- **Reason**: If too much money exists, people don't feel compelled to work
- **Wars**: Often serve to destroy wealth and maintain the scarcity illusion

### 2. The Individual: A Historical Anomaly

#### Ancient vs. Modern Happiness

**Ancient Concept**: Collective happiness
- Community well-being was paramount
- Wealth was shared through feasts and generosity
- Individual identity separate from community didn't exist
- Worst punishment: banishment/exile (not death)

**Modern Concept**: Individual happiness
- Focus on personal fulfillment
- Wealth accumulation for personal benefit
- Isolation from community bonds

#### Two Worldviews: Gods vs. Synapses

**Polytheistic Worldview** (Ancient):
- Multiple gods control fate
- Gods are flawed, vengeful, random
- Humans have no ultimate control
- Response: Live life to the fullest today (**Eudaimonia** - flourishing)
- Encourages collective action and community bonds

**Scientific Worldview** (Modern):
- Humans are collections of memories and synapses
- Individual control over destiny through therapy and self-improvement
- Problems originate within the individual
- Promotes individual responsibility and isolation

> **Key Point**: The modern worldview, despite appearing to grant more control, actually makes people more powerless by preventing collective action and community solidarity.

#### The Therapy Trap

Modern system teaches:
- Problems are internal and individual
- Seek professional help for emotional issues
- Dependency on authority figures (psychiatrists, psychologists)

Traditional wisdom:
- Talk to friends and family
- Exercise and spend time in nature
- Community support for emotional well-being

### 3. School: The Brainwashing Institution

#### The Learning Paradox

**Question**: If school is about learning, why don't we use the apprenticeship model that was successful throughout human history?

**Traditional Learning** (Apprenticeship):
- Learn by doing and observing
- Direct mentorship
- Practical experience from early age
- Anyone can learn anything with proper guidance

**Modern School System**:
- Theoretical knowledge without practice
- Age segregation
- Grading and ranking systems
- Creates artificial intelligence hierarchies

#### Historical Origins of Mandatory Education

Three societies first introduced compulsory public schooling:

1. **Sparta** (Ancient Greece)
   - Military-focused city-state
   - Children removed from families at young ages
   - Trained for warfare

2. **Aztecs** (Central America)
   - Warrior civilization
   - Engaged in constant territorial expansion
   - Used human sacrifice

3. **Prussia** (Europe)
   - Greatest military power in Europe
   - Template for modern education systems
   - Focused on creating obedient soldiers

**Common Thread**: All three were fundamentally **war societies** dedicated to defeating neighbors.

#### The Separation Strategy

**Why separate children from parents?**

- Children with parents feel secure and question authority
- Isolated children become anxious and dependent
- Insecure children accept teacher authority without question
- Creates dependency on institutional figures

#### The Nation State Indoctrination

Schools brainwash students to believe in the **nation state**:

- Artificial construct that didn't exist throughout most of human history
- Creates false identity ("I am Chinese" vs. "I am from Beijing")
- Demands loyalty, sacrifice, and obedience to abstract entity
- History classes implant false memories of national glory
- Geography and language reinforce artificial boundaries

**Traditional Identity**: Local and community-based
**Modern Identity**: Abstract national allegiance to strangers

## The Monotheistic Revolution

### The Source of Modern Concepts

All three pillars of modern power (money, individual, nation state) derive from a revolutionary idea in human thought: **monotheism** - belief in one true God.

**The Three Monotheistic Religions**:
- Judaism
- Christianity  
- Islam

> **Note**: These are essentially the same religion with variations.

### Power as Alchemy

**Traditional Alchemy**: Turning lead into gold (nothing into everything)

**Modern Alchemy (Power)**: 
- Making people believe money has value
- Convincing individuals they can achieve happiness alone
- Creating belief in abstract nation states

Power is the capacity to turn nothing into everything through the manipulation of human imagination.

## The Accidental System

**Important Recognition**: This system was not deliberately designed by evil masterminds. It's an **accident of human imagination** - we created it without fully understanding what we were doing.

**The Hope**: Since human imagination created this system, we can use that same imagination to create a new system that promotes **eudaimonia** (human flourishing) instead of misery.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Reality is constructed** through human imagination, not objective truth
2. **Money is infinite**, not scarce - scarcity is artificially maintained
3. **Individual happiness** is a modern concept that isolates people from community bonds
4. **Schools exist primarily** to create obedient citizens, not to educate
5. **Nation states** are artificial constructs requiring constant reinforcement
6. **Power operates through alchemy** - making people believe in valuable illusions
7. **The system is accidental** and therefore changeable

## Questions for Reflection

- How do these three concepts (money, individual, nation state) shape your daily decisions?
- What would society look like if we returned to community-based values?
- How can we distinguish between genuine learning and institutional indoctrination?
- What role does collective action play in creating meaningful change?
- How might we reconstruct society to promote human flourishing over obedience?
